C API
=====

The C API is broken down into a :ref:`high-level API <hl-api>`,
which handles compression of entire arrays, and a
:ref:`low-level-api <ll-api>` for processing individual blocks
and managing the underlying bit stream.

**The C API structure is broken; need to incorporate low- and high-level APIs.**
